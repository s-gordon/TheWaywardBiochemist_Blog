Settlers of Catan is one of my favourite games. Unfortunately the huge number
of pieces make packing it up and putting it away a nightmare. There must be a
better way! The solution: custom inserts.

I came across an [Imgur post](https://imgur.com/a/AJB0s) where a user had put
together a nice looking Catan insert from foam core. I've had a play at making
inserts for other games in the past, including Tokaido and Elder Sign, and have
had pretty good results. Following on this success, I wanted to see how it
would go with Settlers of Catan. Handling foam core is easy. All you need is a
box cutter, pen and paper, and a hot melt craft glue gun.

Starting out with the base, I wanted to try and accommodate the resource tiles,
player tokens, award cards, and border tiles. The resource tiles fit nicely
into a square cut into the corner, and the border tiles I managed to fit along
the side, cutting semi-hexagons along the top so that I can pull them out
easily. This left *just* enough room for the award cards to fit.

Next up were the player tokens (settlements, cities, and roads). For this, I
made a bunch of little boxes that snuggled against one another in the gap left
from the previous step. I left just enough room along the top for the point
tokens, dice, and the robber token. Looking good so far!

For the next layer, I wanted to fit in the remaining pieces: the resource
cards. To do this, I divided a piece of foamcore into two halves just wide
enough to fit three stacks of cards (with dividers!).

This is with everything laid out.

The finishing touches: adding the instruction manual.
