# Me #

I’m Shane Gordon. I’m a Melbourne-based biochemist/molecular modeller, PhD
student, technical officer, and avid road cyclist.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WaywardBiochem),

The lightning-fast theme, using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework,
was originally created by [Jan Czizikow](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek)
and modified by me. The source code is freely available from my [Github
repository](https://github.com/s-gordon/TheWaywardBiochemist_Blog). Go ahead and
fork it.
